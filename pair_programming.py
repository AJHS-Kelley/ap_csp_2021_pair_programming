# The student whose birthday is earliest in the year is Programmer #1.  The other student is Programmer #2.  If both students share a birthday, the taller student is Programmer #1.  
# Programmer #1 and #2 will take turns writing code.  Programmer #1 will start coding.
# Programmer #1 can write, change, or delete EVEN NUMBERED LINES OF CODE ONLY. 
# Programmer #2 can write, change, or delete ODD NUMBERED LINES OF CODE ONLY. 
# LINE NUMBERING MAY CHANGE AS YOU WRITE YOUR CODE SO PAY ATTENTION! 
# Each programmer can switch their turn at any time.  Sometimes the teacher will tell students to switch.
# Each programmer must COMMIT AND SUBMIT before switching turns.  
# Make sure to FETCH any changes when your turn starts. 


# The next two lines declare variables named programmer1_name and programmer2_name.  They are assigned string values. Each programmer should update the correct line. 
programmer1_name = "Type Your Name Here"
programmer2_name = "Type Your Name Here"

# On the next two lines, each programmer should use print() to display their name on the screen.

# Programmer #1 edit this comment to indicate your FAVORITE FOOD and NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINK.

# On line 22 declare a variable named x and assign it a value of 10.  On line 23 declare a variable named y and assign a value of 3.14


# x has been assigned an INTEGER (written as int in Python) data type.  Y has been assigned a FLOAT (written as float) data type.

# On Line 27, print out the result of (x + y) * -1.  On Line 28, print out the result of (x - y) * 1.

    # Code 'inside' a loop is indented 4 spaces in Python.  This tells the computer those lines of code 'belong' to the loop. 
    # On this line have the code print the num_loops variable onto the screen. 
    # On this line have the code add 1 to the num_loops variable. 

# This code is no longer 4-spaces indented, we are 'out of the loop'.  
# On this line print the result of num_loops divided by y. 
# On this line print the result of num_loops multiplied by x.
